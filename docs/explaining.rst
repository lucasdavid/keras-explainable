Explaining Model's Predictions
==============================

This library has the function :py:func:`keras_explainable.explain` as core
component, which is used to execute any AI explaining method and technique.

Think of it as the :py:meth:`keras.Model#fit` or :py:meth:`keras.Model#predict`
loops of Keras' models, in which the execution graph of the operations
contained in a model is compiled (conditioned to :py:attr:`Model.run_eagerly`
and :py:attr:`Model.jit_compile`) and the explaining maps are computed
according to the method's strategy.

Just like in :py:meth:`keras.model#predict`, :py:func:`keras_explainable.explain`
allows various types of input data and retrieves the Model's associated
distribute strategy in order to distribute the workload across multiple
GPUs and/or workers.

  import os
  import numpy as np
  import pandas as pd
  import tensorflow as tf
  from keras.utils import load_img, img_to_array

  import keras_explainable as ke

  SOURCE_DIRECTORY = 'docs/_static/images/'
  SAMPLES = 8
  SIZES = (299, 299)

  file_names = os.listdir(SOURCE_DIRECTORY)
  image_paths = [os.path.join(SOURCE_DIRECTORY, f) for f in file_names if f != '_links.txt']
  images = np.stack([img_to_array(load_img(ip).resize(SIZES)) for ip in image_paths])[:SAMPLES]

  print('Images shape =', images.shape[1:])
  print('Images avail =', len(images))
  print('Images used  =', SAMPLES)

  images = images[:SAMPLES]

Firstly, we employ the :py:class:`ResNet101` network pre-trained over the
ImageNet dataset:

.. jupyter-execute::

    WEIGHTS = 'imagenet'

    input_tensor = tf.keras.Input(shape=(*SIZES, 3), name='inputs')

    rn101 = tf.keras.applications.ResNet101V2(
      input_tensor=input_tensor,
      classifier_activation=None,
      weights=WEIGHTS
    )
    rn101.trainable = False
    rn101.compile(
      optimizer='sgd',
      loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
    )

    prec = tf.keras.applications.resnet_v2.preprocess_input
    decode_predictions = tf.keras.applications.resnet_v2.decode_predictions

    print(f'ResNet101 with {WEIGHTS} pre-trained weights loaded.')
    print(f"Spatial map sizes: {rn101.get_layer('avg_pool').input.shape}")

We can feed-foward the samples once and get the predicted classes for each sample.
Besides making sure the model is outputing the expected classes, this step is
required in order to determine the most activating units in the *logits* layer,
which improves performance of the explaining methods.

.. jupyter-execute::

  inputs = prec(images.copy())
  logits = rn101.predict(inputs, verbose=0)

  indices = np.argsort(logits, axis=-1)[:, ::-1]
  probs = tf.nn.softmax(logits).numpy()
  predictions = decode_predictions(probs, top=1)

Finally, we can simply run all available explaining methods:

.. jupyter-execute::

  rn101 = ke.inspection.expose(rn101)

  explaining_units = indices[:, :1]  # First most likely class.

  _, c_maps = ke.cam(rn101, inputs, explaining_units)
  _, gc_maps = ke.gradcam(rn101, inputs, explaining_units)
  _, gcpp_maps = ke.gradcampp(rn101, inputs, explaining_units)
  _, sc_maps = ke.scorecam(rn101, inputs, explaining_units)

Following the original Grad-CAM paper, we only consider the positive contributing regions
in the creation of the CAMs, crunching negatively contributing and non-related regions together:

.. jupyter-execute::

  all_maps = (c_maps, gc_maps, gcpp_maps, sc_maps)
  images = images.astype(np.uint8).repeat(1 + len(all_maps), axis=0)

  ke.utils.visualize(
    images=images,
    overlay=sum(zip([None] * len(images), *all_maps), ()),
    cols=1 + len(all_maps),
  )
